# Rust Basics for Web3Cebu: Polkadot Workshop

Welcome to the **Polkadot Workshop: Intro to Rust for Web3Cebu** repository! This repo contains essential resources, documentation, and example scripts to guide you through the basics of Rust, focusing on building in the Web3 ecosystem with Polkadot.

## Repository Structure

The repo is organized into the following directories:

- **`docs/`**: Contains comprehensive documentation on Rust topics. These materials will help you understand core Rust concepts relevant to Polkadot development.
  
- **`examples/`**: Contains practical example scripts demonstrating Rust code. These examples are designed to provide hands-on experience and reinforce the concepts discussed in the `docs/` section.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure the following tools are installed on your machine:

- **Rust Toolchain**: Install Rust via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
- **Polkadot.js**: Install the [Polkadot.js API](https://polkadot.js.org/) if needed for Polkadot integration.

### Cloning the Repository

To clone this repository, use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rust-basics-web3-cebu-polkadot.git
```

## Running the Examples

To run the example scripts, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `examples/` directory:

    ```bash
    cd examples/
    ```

2. Use `cargo` to run the specific example script you want to execute:

    ```bash
    cargo run --example <example-name>
    ```

    Replace `<example-name>` with the name of the example script you'd like to run. For example:

    ```bash
    cargo run --example hello_world
    ```

3. If additional dependencies or packages are required, you will be prompted to install them through `cargo`. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete installation.

## Topics Covered

The workshop covers the following Rust fundamentals:

- Basic Syntax
- Variables and Data Types
- Ownership and Borrowing
- Functions and Modules
- Error Handling
- Traits and Generics
- Rust for Web3 and Polkadot Development
